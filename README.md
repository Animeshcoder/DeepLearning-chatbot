## Features  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines semantic search with generative AI for precise and informative responses.  
- **Advanced Textbook Analysis**: Extracts and contextualizes information from deep learning resources.  
- **Comprehensive Explanations**: Simplifies complex topics with detailed, user-friendly responses.  
- **Model Optimization**: Selects the best-performing model for each query using sentence similarity techniques.  

---

## Tech Stack  

- **Retrieval**: Sentence similarity models (e.g., SBERT, USE)  
- **Generation**: Generative models (e.g., Gemini Flash 1.5, fine-tuned transformers)  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask/FastAPI  
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP

## How It Works  

1. **Query Handling**: Users ask questions related to deep learning concepts.  
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Relevant textbook excerpts are retrieved using semantic search.  
3. **Response Generation**: The generative model provides a detailed, context-aware explanation.
